# Exponentially Weighted Moving Average Covariance Matrix
# An exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) puts more weight on the more recent observations, and thus takes some account of the dynamic ordering in returns.  When an EWMA is applied to squared returns the resulting volatility estimate will react immediately following an unusually large return.  Then the effect of this return in the EWMA gradually diminishes over time.  The reaction of EWMA volatility estimates to market events therefore persist over time, and with a strength determined by the smoothing constant \lambda.  This is a number between 0 and 1.  The larger the value of \lambda the more weight is placed on past observations and so the smoother the series becomes.  (Alexander, 2001)
# 
# Look up how to calculate a covariance matrix using EWMA
# Calculate the 4 minimum variance portfolio with this matrix using 4 different \lambdas.  Compare the weights for these 4 different \lambdas and the equal weighted (normal covariance matrix from Part 3)
